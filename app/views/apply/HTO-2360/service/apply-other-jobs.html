      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Civil service employment</h2>

<p>Your employer will provide support instead of Access to Work, unless you need mental health support.</p>
     <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You will need to contact your employer so they can assess and arrange the support you need.
      </div>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need mental health support</h2>
<p>You can get mental health support through Access to Work for all types of jobs, including your civil service employment. </p>
<p>You can apply for mental health support directly from <a rel="external" href="https://able-futures.co.uk/individuals">Able Futures</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.remploy.co.uk/employers/mental-health-and-wellbeing/workplace-mental-health-support-service-employers">Remploy</a>.</p>

<p>These providers will contact Access to Work on your behalf. You will not need to tell your employer.</p>



     <!--
     <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Self-employment or other employment</h2>


      <p>If your grant includes self-employment, or other non-civil service employment, you can <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">renew part of your Access to Work grant</a>. </p>

      <p>You will still need to contact your civil service employer to arrange any support you need for that employment.</p>
