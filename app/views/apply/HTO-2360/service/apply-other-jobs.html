      <p>If you are a civil servant, your employer will provide support instead of Access to Work. You must contact your employer so they can assess and arrange the support you need. </p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
       Access to Work can cover mental health support for civil servants, provided by <a href="https://able-futures.co.uk/individuals">Able Futures</a> and <a href="https://www.remploy.co.uk/about-us/current-programmes/access-work-mental-health-support-service/">Remploy</a> (both links open in new tabs). You can apply to these suppliers directly for the support you need.

      <p>If your grant includes self-employment, or other non-civil service employment, you can <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">renew part of your Access to Work grant</a>. </p>

      <p>You will still need to contact your civil service employer to arrange any support you need for that employment.</p>
