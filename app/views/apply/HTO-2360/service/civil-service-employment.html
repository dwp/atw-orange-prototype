      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to get support for your civil service employment</h1>



      <p>As you are a civil servant, your employer will provide support instead of Access to Work, unless you need mental health support.</p>
       <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You will need to contact your employer so they can assess and arrange the support you need.
      </div>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need mental health support</h2>
   <p>You can still get Access to Work for mental health services if you are a civil servant. You can apply for support from either:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"> 
<li><a href="https://able-futures.co.uk/individuals">Able Futures</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.remploy.co.uk/about-us/current-programmes/access-work-mental-health-support-service/">Remploy</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>These providers will contact Access to Work on your behalf. You will not need to tell your employer.</p>
