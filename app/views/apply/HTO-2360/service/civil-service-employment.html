      <p>As you are a civil servant, your employer will provide support instead of Access to Work. You will need to contact your employer so that they can assess and arrange the support you need.</p>
      <p>If you're not sure if you are a civil servant, check with your employer.</p>


      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
       Access to Work can cover mental health support for civil servants, provided by <a href="https://able-futures.co.uk/individuals">Able Futures</a> and <a href="https://www.remploy.co.uk/about-us/current-programmes/access-work-mental-health-support-service/">Remploy</a> (both links open in new tabs). You can apply to these suppliers directly for the support you need.
