      <p>If your grant includes self-employment, or other non-civil service employment, you can <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">renew part of your Access to Work grant</a>. </p>

      <p>You will still need to contact your civil service employer to arrange any support you need for that employment.</p>

      <p>You can find your grant end date on your award letter or renewal reminder.</p>
